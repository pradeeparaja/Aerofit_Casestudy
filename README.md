## About Aerofit

Aerofit is a leading brand in the field of fitness equipment. Aerofit provides a product range including machines such as treadmills, exercise bikes, gym equipment, and fitness accessories to cater to the needs of all categories of people.

## Business Problem

1. The market research team at AeroFit wants to identify the characteristics of the target audience for each type of treadmill offered by the company, to provide a better recommendation of the treadmills to the new customers. The team decides to investigate whether there are differences across the product with respect to customer characteristics.

2. Perform descriptive analytics to create a customer profile for each AeroFit treadmill product by developing appropriate tables and charts.
For each AeroFit treadmill product, construct two-way contingency tables and compute all conditional and marginal probabilities along with their insights/impact on the business.

## Insights:

1. The age ranges from 18 to 50 . The most common age group appears to be 25 years old, with a count of 25 individuals.

2. The dataset shows that a majority of customers are partnered (107 individuals) compared to single customers
 (73 individuals). This indicates that partnered individuals might be more inclined to purchase fitness equipment
 such as treadmills from Aerofit.

3. Among the treadmills offered by Aerofit (KP281, KP481, and KP781), KP281 is the most popular choice among customers, 
with 80 purchases recorded.

4. The mean fitness level varies slightly between genders. Further analysis reveals that the probability of a 
female customer purchasing a KP481 treadmill is approximately 38.16%. This suggests that gender may influence the choice 
of treadmill models.

5. The correlation matrix provides insights into the relationships between variables. For example, there is a positive 
correlation between age and income, suggesting that older customers tend to have higher incomes.

6. Boxplots were used to detect outliers in variables such as age, income, fitness level, and miles. Outliers, if present,
 can provide insights into customer behavior or anomalies in the data that may require further investigation.

## Recommendations:

1. Leverage the age distribution data to tailor marketing campaigns that resonate with the most common age group 
 (around 25 years old). Consider using digital platforms and social media channels popular among younger adults to 
 promote Aerofit's treadmill products.

2. While KP281 is the most popular treadmill model, explore opportunities to enhance the features and marketing of 
  KP481 and KP781 to attract more customers.

3. Implement customer engagement programs such as loyalty rewards, referral bonuses, and exclusive offers for 
 partnered customers. Encourage repeat purchases and referrals by providing incentives and discounts based on customer 
 loyalty and engagement.

4. Since there is a slight variation in mean fitness levels between genders, develop gender-specific marketing 
 campaigns that address the unique fitness needs and preferences of male and female customers. Highlight the fitness
 benefits of using Aerofit treadmills tailored to each gender segment.

5. Regularly monitor customer feedback, reviews, and sales trends to stay updated with evolving customer preferences
 and market dynamics. 

6. Create educational content, such as workout guides, training videos, and fitness tips, to accompany Aerofit's treadmill
 products. 

7. Collaborate with fitness influencers, gyms, wellness centers, and sports events to increase brand visibility and
 reach a wider audience. 

8. By implementing these recommendations, Aerofit can strengthen its market presence, attract new customers,
 retain existing ones, and drive sustainable growth in the fitness equipment industry.
